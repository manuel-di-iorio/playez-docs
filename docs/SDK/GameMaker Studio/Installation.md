To integrate the SDK in your game, you just need to download the latest SDK from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.gamemaker.io/assets/12043/playez-scores-achievements-and-more).

You'll download the zip file with the .yyp project. In the assets, you will see a _Playez_ folder with all the functions that you may want to call. There will be also a demo folder with an example to test the basic functions to login, send and get scores.
